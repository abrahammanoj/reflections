How to write a commit message
You're about to make your first commit to your reflections repository.
When you do this, you'll need to write a commit message describing your changes.
If you followed the instructions in the "Setting Up Your Workspace" video for
your platform near the end of Lesson 1, the editor you chose will appear as
soon as you run git commit and allow you to write a commit message.
If you get an error message, you should try revisiting the instructions
in Lesson 1 and make sure your text editor is set up properly.

You can also specify a commit message via the command line by
running git commit -m "Commit message" instead of just git commit.
It's still a good idea to get an editor set up, since this will make it
easier to write long commit messages that fully describe the change.
